Hi, my name is Zhitao (Terence) Pan. I'm currently studying Master of Software Engineering at the Universit of Melbourne. Prior to this, I completed a BEng degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at University College London in the UK.

I found my interests in programming and computer science in general when I was studying Java in one of my undergraduate subjects. I really enjoy the process of creating a software with logics and algorithms and using it to solve real world problems. 

<br>You can find my posts and projects about computer science here.
